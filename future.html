									<p>In the future StembryoNet or similar AI could be staple technology for developmental biologists. 
										Currently research on EtiX-embryos is done by expert scientists who analyze each individual embryo with a microscope.
										However StembryoNet accelerates this process by using AI eliminates human error and accelerates embryo analysis drastically. </p>

										<p>StembryoNet has also proven itself to be incredibly useful due to it’s early prediction capabilities. 
										This feature is incredibly useful for all types of researchers because knowing which embryos will be 
										viable in an experiment can save scientists lots of time and resources that may have gone towards unviable
										embryos. This technology is already on its way to advancing even farther since it’s studying larger sets
										of data and will eventually incorporate higher resolution imaging once it’s available. All these adjustments
										are made so the AI can detect even subtler developmental cues at earlier stages.</p>
										
										<p>These advancements in technology can be used to support precision engineering on embryos in the future.
										It was seen that EtiX embryos had better development success when they had greater numbers of initial stem cells. 
										StembryoNet is also intelligent enough to discover optimal cell ratios and culture conditions for successful 
										embryo development. Since StembryoNet can communicate it’s findings and other feedback in real time scientists
										can adjust their own parameters instantaneously to increase successful embryo development rates.</p>

										<a class="image main"><img src="100-reproduction_spotlight-scifi_feat.webp" alt="Future of AI in Embryology" /></a>
										
									    <p>Eventually StembryoNet will be revolutionary for understanding fertility and fetal defects in human embryos, 
										but not until it’s deemed ethical and guidelines are put in place for using such technology on humans. 
										StembryoNet has the potential to be used in genomic studies as well such as single-cell RNA sequencing to 
										uncover which genes may code for certain morphological features and phenotypes. This information would disclose
									    new information into how human morphology and organoid systems have evolved and how human development has
										evolved throughout time. Once StembryoNet reaches the point of human usage it can be adapted to identify
										early biomarkers of developmental disorders and even be used to engineer organoid and tissue models. 
										StembryoNet works so well at predicting developmental outcomes because of it’s ability to track 
										self-organizing cells. This becomes beneficial while studying cancer tissues, brain structures, and 
										regeneration.
