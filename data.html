								<div class="content">
									<p>To create and test the capabilities of StembryoNet, a large-scale experiment that 
										focused on classifying the developmental success of ETiX- embryos. ETiX embryos are derived 
										from stem-cells and resemble models of early-stage mouse embryogenesis. These ETiX-embryos are 
										formed from three different stem-cell types called ESC’s (Embryonic Stem-Cells), TSC’s (Trophoblast Stem-Cells) 
										and ESC-iGata4 Cells. While these ETiX-embryos were created as models for biology research, they all vary widely 
										in morphology and developmental success. Approximately 23% of all ETiX-embryos developed normally, which limited 
										their use for experiments.</p>

                                    <p>Since developmental success rates were so low, a dataset of 900 ETiX-embryos were generated and recorded using
										 live fluorescent microscopy during the first 90 hours of development. Fluorescent labels allowed researchers
										  to track the three stem-cell types in the ETiX-embryos over time. Expert embryologists then reviewed the 
										  images that were taken throughout the first 90 hours of development. The ETiX-embryos were then deemed as
										  normal or abnormal depending on certain morphological features such cavity formation and tissue organization. </p>

                                    <p>All of this collected data was used to train StembryoNet. Most of the training concentrated on the final 25 hours 
										of development, when it’s obvious whether an embryo is developing properly or not. To further train StembryoNet, 
										researchers used synchronized data which is an alignment of embryos at equivalent developmental stages. StembryoNet 
										was then given a database of unsynchronized data in order to see how effectively it could label more realistic embryo 
										models. StembryoNet proved itself to be 88% accurate at predicting developmental success in ETiX-embryos. StembryoNet 
										could match the accuracy of embryologists as well as perform 18 times faster than them.</p>

                                    <p>StembryoNet was also tested on it’s early stage prediction capabilities and achieved a high 65% accuracy rate in 
										predicting the outcomes of embryos at cell-seedling stages (0 hours). Researchers were also able to show that ETiX-embryos 
										had increased developmental success rates when containing higher initial stem-cell counts. The percentage rates from viable 
										embryos rose from 23% to 32%, which proved that cell quantity is crucial in developmental success.</p>

									<p>Throughout the experiment StembryoNet was also able to categorize ETiX-embryo development in four different pathways. 
										Continuously normal, abnormal to normal, continuously abnormal, and normal to abnormal.  This visualized to researchers 
										that ETiX-embryo outcomes were not easy to predict in early developmental stages. </p>

									<p>The experiment was a success and it’s apparent that StembryoNet will only be improving from here. 
										AI technology isn’t exactly new, but this usage of image analysis in developmental research is certainly exciting.</p>
